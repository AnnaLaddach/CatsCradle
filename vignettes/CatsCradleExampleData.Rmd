## CatsCradle Example Data

CatsCradle has a slightly unusual way of delivering example data.  In
order to save space we have tried to minimise the number and size of
the .rda data.  We have limited these to objects which are necessary
to compute other objects (e.g., certain Seurat objects), objects which
are necessary to the functioning of the package (e.g., human and
mouse ligand receptor networks), and objects which take a long time to
compute (e.g., ligandReceptorResults).  These package variables are
documented in the usual way and are loaded when invoked.

Other variables are computed from these as needed.  The function which
computes these additional objects also stores them internally for
quick retrieval when they are subsequently requested.  The retrieval
function must be created before it can be used.  It only needs to be
created once in each session.


On the first invocation this computes STranspose:

```{r}
library(CatsCradle)
getExample = make.getExample()
STranspose = getExample('STranspose')
```

On subsequent invocations it retrieves it:

```{r}
STranspose = getExample('STranspose')
```

getExample() also retrieves package variables.

```{r}
smallXenium = getExample('smallXenium')
```

A complete list of the example objects available via the function
exampleObjects().  Here we document some of the more prominent of
these.

* __S__ - A Seurat object of cells.  It includes a UMAP of the
cells and annotated clustering into cell types.  This is a package
variable.
* __STranpose__ - A Seurat object of genes.  This is created from S by
transposeSeuratObject().
* __S_sce__ - S as a SingleCellExperiment
* __STranspose_sce__ - STranspose as a SingleCellExperiment
* __NN__ - A nearest neighbours graph from STranspose.  This is a data
frame with columns nodeA, nodeB, and weight, where nodeA and nodeB are
genes.
* __smallXenium__ - A spatial Seurat object subset from the Xenium
object used in 
https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/seurat5_spatial_vignette_2.
This is a package variable.
* __clusters__ - Annotated cell type clustering for the cells of
smallXenium.
* __centroids__ - The centroids of the cells of smallXenium
* __delaunayNeighbours__  - A data frame giving neighbour-neighbour
relations for the cells of smallXenium as estimated by Delaunay
triangulation with columns nodeA and nodeB.
* __extendedNeighours__ - A data frame giving extended
neighbour-neighbour relations for the cells of smallXenium.  Here
cells are "neighbours" if they are within four edges of each other in
the Delaunay triangulation.
* __euclideanNeighbours__ - Neighbour-neighbour relations between the
cells of smallXenium based on the Euclidean distance of their
centroids.
* __NBHDByCTMatrix__ - For each neighbourhood, we count the number of
cells it contains of each cell type. Neighbourhoods "express" cell
types.
* __NBHDByCTSeurat__ - A Seurat object whose underlying counts are
NBHDByCTMatrix. 
* __cellTypesPerCellTypeMatrix__ - A matrix which reports on the
Delaunay neighbourhoods.  For each cell type, it examines the
neighbourhoods around cells of that type and reports their average
composition as to the cell types they contain.
* __cellTypesPerCellTypePValues__ This gives the statistical
significance for the enrichment of cell types in the neighbourhoods of
each cell type.

- makeTheObjects.R For each of the cases {larval, adult, combined}
  this makes and saves the object pair f and fPrime and saves these as
  SeuratObject/{f_,fPrime_}{larval,adult,combined}.rdf
  
- AccessObjects.R This provides getObjectPair and getSeuratObject
  which take the case as an argument.  getObjectPair returns a list
  with elements f and fPrime.  getSeuratObject gets the original
  Seurat object.

- assortedAnalyses.R  This iterates over the cases
  {larval,adult,combined} and makes UMAPs of the gene clusters
  (including browseable clusters), and cat's cradles of mean gene
  expression, i.e., Sankey graphs of mean expression in gene clusters
  vs cell clusters.  UMAPs are in
  figures/umapOfGenes_{case}.{jpg,html}
  Cat's cradles are in
  figures/CellsGenesExpressionUpSankeyGraph_{case}.html
  This also makes lists of the genes in each gene cluster and these
  are in
  tables/geneClusters_{case}.txt

- hallmarkVsGeneClusters.R
  stop('This is kind of a hack regarding mouse v fish')

- orderGeneListsPerCluster.R This finds -log10(p-value) for the
  overlap between the gene clusters and gene lists such as hallmark,
  etc. For each gene cluster we then have a list of p-values for its
  overlap with the given gene list on the given background.  We make a
  table where for each gene cluster we have the specific gene lists
  (e.g., KRAS SIGNALING) and its -log10(pvalue) and these are ordered
  in descening order by the latter.  These are saved in
  tables/{hallmark,etc}_{larval,adult,combined}.txt
